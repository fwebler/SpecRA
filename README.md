# SpecRA
RGB to Spectrum

This code takes RGB data collected from the LYS Button and outputs a reconstructed spectral power distribution in W/m2/nm in 5nm intervals from 380 to 780nm
The resulting spectrum is a 1x81 dimensional vector that can be saved in any format such as .csv

If saved in .csv format the file can be uploaded to the free-to-use CIE validated webtool luox available here: https://luox.app/
luox computes additional information from the spectral power distribution such as color and vision-related quantities
